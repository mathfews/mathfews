# 💫 About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at UNA, building a solid foundation in software engineering and backend development. I primarily work with Python and Node.js, focusing on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding the fundamentals behind authentication, data persistence, and system design. I enjoy building practical projects to deepen my technical knowledge and continuously evolve as a developer.
